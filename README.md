Title: Beginner's Guide to Building Express.js APIs for Diverse Domains

# Introduction

This project provides a starting point and structured guidance for Node.js enthusiasts to practice building RESTful APIs for common scenarios. With a focus on simplicity and clarity, this project aims to help you grasp the essentials of API design and implementation using Express.js.

# Domains Covered

School =fatma
Hospital =mima
Restaurant = anyoka
Bar =james
Bank = leah
Library = mwangi
Hardware Shop = akinyi
Shop (General)
Mechanical Garage = maryanne

# Prerequisites

# Basic understanding of JavaScript syntax.
Node.js and npm (or another package manager) installed on your system.
Familiarity with REST API concepts is beneficial but not strictly required.
Getting Started

Download or Clone the Project:

Download a ZIP archive of the project from (https://github.com/ogola5/digitech2).
Or, use Git: git clone https://github.com/ogola5/digitech2
Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
# Run the command npm install
Set Up Your Database:


# what you need to do
models/: This folder will house your data models (Mongoose schemas or equivalent for your chosen database). Each domain (school, hospital, etc.) will have its corresponding model file.
routes/: Your API routes will be defined here. Each domain will ideally have its own route file for better organization.
controllers/: Controller functions handle the incoming requests, interact with your models to process data, and send back appropriate responses.
server.js: This is the heart of your Express.js application, setting up the server, middleware, and connecting your routes.
How to Use

# Understanding the Basics:
Begin by examining the sample code provided in the existing routes and controllers. This will introduce you to fundamental Express.js patterns.
Build Your Own Routes: Start by adding routes for a specific domain. Design routes to support the standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the entities within that domain.
Expand and Explore: Gradually add routes and models for additional domains.
Next Steps: (Optional)
